# Interview Project: Full Stack, Investor Site

Hello and welcome to the PURE Investor Site!

PURE has a number of individual investors, and we would like to offer them a site where they can login, and review the performance of their investments.

### Your task

In the associated **GitHub Project**, there are a number of **User Stories** to be completed, which will add much needed functionality to an otherwise, pretty useless website.

With your programming pair, complete the stories, in priority order, starting from the top of the backlog.

### What we're looking for

We're looking to see how you approach problems, your communication style with your peers, and how you collaborate in a small team. 

It doesn't matter if you're not an expert with any particular technology. Your pair will help guide you through any idiosyncracies of the tools and language. 

Good luck, and thanks for interviewing with us.
